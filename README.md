HPC Summer School 2024: Foundation in Computational Biomolecular and Biosystem Research
Welcome to the HPC Summer School! This guide will walk you through the process of analyzing molecular dynamics (MD) data using the MAHAMERU BRIN HPC system. The necessary software, such as Yasara structure and ORCA for quantum chemistry calculations, is pre-installed as modules. No additional environment setup is required. Youâ€™re ready to go!

Simply click the top-right corner of each code snippet to copy the commands and paste them directly into your terminal.
